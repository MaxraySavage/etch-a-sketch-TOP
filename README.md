# etch-a-sketch-TOP
An etch-a-sketch. The Etcher is your mouse!
I decided to mimic how an etch-a-sketch actually works, so rather than implement a clear button, you can now click on the etch-a-sketch to shake it and erase the etched squares.

## To-Do list
- [x] Create Repository
- [x] Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs 
- [x] Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. 
- [x] Add a slider that changes the number of squares in the etch-a-sketch
- [x] Added radio buttons to pick whether to shade the squares in as black or as a random color.
